## To Do List

A web based To-Do app built as part of coursework for The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list

**Link**:

**Use**:
Ability to create to do lists grouped by projects and date. 
Tasks can be assigned a priority which give visual cues in the UI. Tasks can be given a description.
Search functionality on the current page that will highlight a task title if the searches matches either the tas title or the description.
Ability to remove projects in their entirety or individual tasks. 
Ability to mark tasks as completed via strikethrough UX.

Note currently the calendar timing is only set for my local timezone (Australian EST), this is something I will look to fix in the future. 

**Future Plans**
- Fix timezone issues
- Add responsive design for mobile devices
- UI/UX improvements
